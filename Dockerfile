# Notes:
# * /etc/passwd is made group-writable because we would add a user,
#     later in entrypoint.sh script.



# Notes about USER:
# ----------------
# * Switch to "non-root" user - 1001  - advised by openshift documentation.
# * This USER <number> directive MUST be set in Dockerfile, 
#      to satisfy openshift requirements.
# * This USER ID can be any number out of your imagination (max 65535),
#      and it does not need to exist anywhere in the system,
#      and doesn't need to be created before-hand.
# * It's purpose is just to show/prove to openshift that the docker image
#     "does" switch away from "root" user. 
# * Once, openshift sees this, it then "ignores this ID as well",
#     and runs the image with a new random USER ID.
# * This new USER ID (uid) is then detected in entrypoint.sh script,
#     and rest of the tricks are done there.
# * See entrypoint.sh script in this image for more information.

USER 1001

# The variable below is used by docker entrypoint.sh script,
#   to create an entry in /etc/passwd with this username, 
#   and using the (random) uid set by openshift.
#
ENV RUNTIME_USER_NAME=okduser

# What does OKD mean? 
# Few years ago "OpenShift Origin" was renamed to OKD. Not sure why.
#   Confuses the hell out of people.
# Silly explanation here: https://learn.redhat.com/t5/Containers-DevOps-OpenShift/What-does-the-acronym-OKD-stand-for/td-p/246


# Start nginx in foreground:
CMD ["/usr/sbin/nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]


# Note: If you have not included the "bash" package, 
#         then it is "mandatory" to add "/bin/sh"
#         in the ENTNRYPOINT instruction. 
#       Otherwise you will get strange errors when you try to run the container. 
#       Such as:
#       standard_init_linux.go:219: exec user process caused: no such file or directory

# Run the startup script as ENTRYPOINT, which does few things and then starts nginx.
ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/sh", "/docker/entrypoint.sh"]
